      I'm a web developer specializing in Node.js and React.js. I'm currently looking for a collaborative, cross-functional, user-centered team to learn from and solve problems with in New York. <a href='Chloe_Rice.pdf' target='_blank'>This</a> is how I look on a single sheet of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe in a free and open web, growing food over lawns, 80's workout tapes over gyms, bikes over cars, and never wearing anything you can’t do a roundhouse kick in.
    </p>

      When I’m not building the internet, I love creating whimsical landscapes, undercover unitards, and vegan deliciousness for the obscurely allergic. I’m also one of those crazy people that runs far in the wilderness for no good reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m always on the lookout for side projects that matter and good conversation. Don’t hesitate to reach out!
